= ActsAsList

This acts_as extension provides the capabilities for sorting and reordering a
number of objects in a list. The class that has this specified needs to have
a +position+ column defined as an integer on the mapped database table.

This plugin derived from David Heinemeier Hansson acts_as_list but has been
refactored to make it less obtrusive and more "Ruby on Rails 2.1+"-y.


== Example

  class TodoList < ActiveRecord::Base
    has_many :todo_items, :order => "position"
  end

  class TodoItem < ActiveRecord::Base
    belongs_to :todo_list
    acts_as_list :scope => :todo_list
  end

  todo_list.first.move_to_bottom
  todo_list.last.move_higher

  TodoList.order_by_ids([1, 3, 2, 5, 4])
  TodoList.order_by_ids(%w(1 3 2 4 5))
